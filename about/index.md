## Hi, I'm Raphael アモリム

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raphamorims) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/raphamorims/).

Brazilian software engineer at **Viaplay** and **jQuery** member. I love Japanese culture (親日), travel around the globe, listen to 60s-90s songs, telecaster guitars and 8bit art. Currently, I am living in Stockholm, Sweden.

I like to create music, if you want to listen: [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/artist/raphael-amorim/1547161397?l=en) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Ij2Lu765q7pjWuXHOUF0s).

Previously, I had work in companies like Spotify, GoDaddy, Globo.com and Videolog.

I love compilers, WebAssembly and GL. Currently, I'm having some fun writing a lightweight language called [Kyoto](https://github.com/raphamorim/kyoto) powered by LLVM.

Speaker at over some [conferences & events](/talks) giving talks about JavaScript, Web Perfomance, React, Canvas/WebGL and development processes.

In 2015 was one of the most active software developers in the world list on GitHub having done meaningful contributions to open source projects for 513 days in a row.

Already have worked as Mozilla Learning volunteer in web literacy projects (e.g: Rio Mozilla Club). Author of some open source projects, e.g: [React-Ape](https://github.com/raphamorim/react-ape), [React-TV](https://github.com/react-tv/react-tv), [Origami.js](https://raphamorim.io/origamijs).
