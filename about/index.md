## Hi, I'm [Raphael Amorim](https://twitter.com/raphamorims)

<i>- "Web surfer"</i>

Previously, I had work in companies like Viaplay, Spotify, GoDaddy and Globo.com. Enthusiast about compilers, WebAssembly and Rust. Speaker in a few [conferences](/talks).

I also like to create music, if you want to listen: [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/artist/raphael-amorim/1547161397?l=en) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Ij2Lu765q7pjWuXHOUF0s).
