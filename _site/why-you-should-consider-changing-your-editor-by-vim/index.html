<p>Here is what I learned so far:</p>

<h3 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve</h3>

<p>I felt the difference between vim and other editors in short time. Vim’s learning curve is something to stand out.</p>

<p>At the beginning, it was quite difficult, to be honest. Everything you are used to do on other editors becomes different. You have to relearn basic things like creating a new line and deleting a word “The Vim Way”. But I kept using it.</p>

<p>I was determined to continue using Vim, reading more about it and learning tricks. I ook me a while to get used to using Vim’s shortcuts, but I really like that now. It feels like playing some game when I use “vim combos” in keyboard. Damn! This is really cool.</p>

<p>Cool link about vim learning curve: <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth">The Vim Learning Curve is a Myth</a></p>

<h3 id="oh-you-are-really-fast">Oh! you are really fast</h3>

<p>Something obvious is the speed of vim to open or edit some file. But vim isn’t about speed, neither anything related with this. It’s about practicality. Vim lets you can edit so fast any file/project using terminal.</p>

<p>Now you need not wait for the editor to be able to open that little quick change to the file.</p>

<p>Cool link: <a href="http://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/03/27/vim-speed-is-not-really-the-point/">Vim speed is not really the point</a></p>

<h3 id="fully-hackable">Fully hackable</h3>

<p>It is one of the few code editors allow you to configure shortcuts, syntax, text format and so much more. Its fully changeable.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest thing I’ve done in this little time was looking for new shortcuts and tricks to my Vimrc. I ended up seeing many Vimrc from many awesome devs.</p>

<p>Also have made available my: <a href="https://github.com/raphamorim/vimfiles">Rapha’s vim files</a></p>

<h3 id="think-more-before-do-anything">Think more before do anything</h3>

<p>Think more before doing anything At first things were complicated. I did not know many shortcuts. I was taking quite a lot to make even small changes. I had to think more on what was going to do.</p>
