## Olá • Hello • こんにちは

My name is Raphael Amorim.

Previously, I worked at companies like Viaplay, Spotify, GoDaddy, and Globo.com. I have been a speaker at a few [conferences](/talks). I am an enthusiast about compilers, WebAssembly, and Rust.

I was responsible for Viaplay's adoption of the Rust language. I built the starter infrastructure, released the first service for production, and actively worked on developing a Rust culture, which led to the language's adoption in the upcoming years, along with many other feats. [See when it all started](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hugoraphael_i-dont-post-very-often-in-the-linkedin-but-activity-6975346956734738432-Csqi).

I wrote a book about WebAssembly in Portuguese.

In 2015, I was one of the most active software developers in the world on GitHub, having made meaningful contributions to open-source projects for 513 days in a row.

Currently, I am having fun building a terminal application written in Rust, called [Rio](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio).

I also like to create music. If you want to listen, check out [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/artist/raphael-amorim/1547161397?l=en) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Ij2Lu765q7pjWuXHOUF0s).
