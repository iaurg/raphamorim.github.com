## Olá • Hello • こんにちは

My name is Raphael Amorim.

Previously, I worked in companies like Viaplay, Spotify, GoDaddy and Globo.com. Speaker in a few [conferences](/talks). Enthusiast about compilers, WebAssembly and Rust.

I have been responsible for Viaplay adoption of Rust language. Built starter infrastructure, released the first service for production, actively worked on developing Rust culture which led to the language adoption in the upcoming years, along with many other feats, [see when it all started](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hugoraphael_i-dont-post-very-often-in-the-linkedin-but-activity-6975346956734738432-Csqi).

Wrote a book about WebAssembly in Portuguese.

Currently having fun building a terminal application written in Rust, called [Rio](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio).

I also like to create music, if you want to listen: [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/artist/raphael-amorim/1547161397?l=en) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Ij2Lu765q7pjWuXHOUF0s).
