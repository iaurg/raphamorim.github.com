## Sometimes, I like to create music.

I mean, occasionally... <br/><br/><br/>

#### Heart of the Rainforest

Lo-Fi beat that I made using Akai MPK Mini MK3<br/><br/>

#### Blinding Lights (Study Session)

The process of learning the song using different instruments. In case you ask: I have used GarageBand and the beats are quite inspired by a lot of youtube covers, basically I've picked beats from different videos and mixed up lol.<br/><br/>
